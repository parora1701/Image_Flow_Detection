    CONSOLE APPLICATION : Image_Flow_Detection Project Overview
========================================================================

This solution uses openCV Farneback mechanism to calculate image difference between two images. Image_Flow_Detection captures webcam video, converts them into frames then passes two consecutive frames to Farneback calculate method and finally draws a line between the difference. Hence output is movement in front of camera is tracked.
